# Making charts with Semiotic

Increasingly at Recidiviz we are using [Semiotic](https://semiotic.nteract.io/)
as our go-to chart library. It offers a good balance of reasonable defaults
and great flexibility for custom visualizations, making it one of the more
powerful off-the-shelf chart libraries in the React ecosystem.

As a result, it can present a steeper learning curve than simpler libraries
such as chart.js, which we have also used exensively in the past. This document
provides a short introduction and cheat-sheet for getting started with Semiotic
and using it in Recidiviz web applications.

## ChartWrapper

You will see the `ChartWrapper` component being used in the below examples.
This component is provided by this design system and should be wrapped around
all Semiotic components to provide baseline brand styling, including typefaces and
some colors.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="ChartWrapper" args={{ className: "" }}>
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        axes={[
          {
            orient: "left",
            label: "frequency",
          },
        ]}
        data={letterFrequency}
        oAccessor="letter"
        oLabel
        oPadding={5}
        rAccessor="frequency"
        size={[600, 300]}
        title="English alphabet usage"
        type="bar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={ChartWrapper} />

It accepts a `className` prop and so can be extended by CSS or `styled-components` as needed.

## Overview of Semiotic concepts

[Semiotic](https://semiotic.nteract.io/) provides only a handful of generic components that
can render many types of charts. These components are known as "frames" and correspond to
the different types of data that Semiotic can visualize.

- `XYFrame`: for when you have two continuous variables. Produces line and area charts,
  scatterplots, and the like.
- `OrdinalFrame`: for when you have one continuous variable and one non-continuous variable.
  Good for bar charts, pie charts, timelines, and many others.
- `NetworkFrame`: for when you have relationship data that can be represented as nodes
  and/or edges. Produces network diagrams, path diagrams, and hierarchical diagrams.
  (We don't do much of this at Recidiviz, so it's not discussed in detail here; refer
  to the Semiotic docs for further information.)

These components each accept a large number of props, which represent a combination of
data inputs, configuration options, and rendering instructions. Rendering instructions
generally accept JSX or functions that return JSX, which makes them a powerful tool for
customizing chart output (`tooltipContent` being one prominent example that all frames
support; it accepts a function that receives data associated with the targeted point and
returns JSX to be rendered in place.)

## Working with data

Semiotic, for the most part, does not require any particular data structure for its input;
instead, you provide "data accessor" props that tell the component how to extract
variables from your input data.

### XY data

XY points should be represented as objects. The properties can be anything you like:

```js
const points = [
  { time: 1, temperature: 15, size: 400 },
  { time: 2, temperature: 13, size: 401 },
  ...
]
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Points">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <XYFrame
        axes={[{ orient: "left" }, { orient: "bottom" }]}
        points={exoplanets}
        size={[700, 300]}
        xAccessor="distance"
        yAccessor="radius"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The `xAccessor` and `yAccessor` props determine what properties are plotted. As a shorthand,
string values will be treated as property names. Otherwise, pass a function.

```jsx
<XYFrame
  points={points}
  xAccessor="time"
  // trivial example but you get the idea
  yAccessor=((point) => point.temperature)
 />
```

To draw your points on a line, pass one or more objects that include your points as a property
called `coordinates`. (This is the default, but you can
[change it](https://semiotic.nteract.io/api/xyframe#linedataaccessor--string--function-)).
Each of these objects will be drawn as a separate line.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Lines">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <XYFrame
        axes={[{ orient: "left" }, { orient: "bottom" }]}
        lines={[
          {
            coordinates: cityTemperature.map((r, i) => ({
              time: i,
              temp: Number(r.Austin),
            })),
          },
        ]}
        size={[700, 400]}
        xAccessor="time"
        yAccessor="temp"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Order matters! Points on a line will be connected in the order they appear in, and Semiotic
won't sort them for you to make them continuous from left to right. Sort them yourself before
passing the prop if necessary.

### Ordinal and categorical data

Similar idea; records are represented by objects that can have whatever properties you like,
and you pass the props `oAccessor` (for "ordinal") and `rAccessor` (for "range") to determine
what gets plotted.

The `data` prop is always a single, flat array; for stacked or grouped bars, either pass
multiple properties to `rAccessor` or spread your multiple values out to separate records,
depending on what your data looks like.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Bars">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        axes={[
          {
            orient: "left",
          },
        ]}
        data={letterFrequency}
        oAccessor="letter"
        oLabel
        oPadding={5}
        rAccessor="frequency"
        size={[600, 300]}
        type="bar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        axes={[
          {
            orient: "bottom",
          },
        ]}
        data={cityTemperature.slice(0, 5)}
        margin={{ left: 75, bottom: 40 }}
        oAccessor="date"
        oLabel
        oPadding={15}
        projection="horizontal"
        rAccessor={["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"]}
        size={[600, 300]}
        type="clusterbar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You may have noticed `projection="horizontal"` in the example above, an effect of
Semiotic eschewing the notions of X and Y entirely for categorical data. You can also
set the projection to `radial` for polar charts and other such circular delicacies.
Somewhat counterintuitively, this is how you create pie and donut charts. In
Semiotic these are considered a variant of bar charts; set the projection to
`"radial"` and use the `dynamicColumnWidth` prop instead of `rAccessor`.

export const pieData = [
  { status: "Eaten", amount: 500 },
  { status: "Uneaten", amount: 145 },
];

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Pies">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        data={pieData}
        oAccessor="status"
        dynamicColumnWidth="amount"
        oLabel
        projection="radial"
        size={[300, 300]}
        type="bar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Using color

While `ChartWrapper` does provide some limited default coloring for common chart types,
Semiotic in general does nothing by default when it comes to color. It doesn't even
have any props that specifically address it, as it tries generally to make very few assumptions
about how you want to control the appearance of your marks beyond what is absolutely necessary.

When you need a color that isn't supplied by default, or you want to color your marks
dynamically based on the data, the customary approach is to use one of the style props:
`style` for `OrdinalFrame`, and `pointStyle` and/or `lineStyle` for `XYFrame`. These take
either a static React style object or a function that accepts the corresponding data point
(and its index) and returns a style object. (Keep in mind it will render SVG, so you need
to use `stroke` and `fill`, et al.)

You can build a hash of your colors, look them up by index, compute them on the fly,
or simply merge them into your input data - whatever makes the most sense for your use case.
For a basic categorical color palette, you should use the `palette.data.defaultOrder` array.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Using colors">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        axes={[
          {
            orient: "left",
          },
        ]}
        data={cityTemperature.slice(0, 5)}
        oAccessor="date"
        oLabel
        oPadding={15}
        rAccessor={["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"]}
        size={[600, 300]}
        // the rIndex property corresponds to the order in rAccessor
        style={(d) => ({ fill: palette.data.defaultOrder[d.rIndex] })}
        type="clusterbar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        data={pieData}
        oAccessor="status"
        dynamicColumnWidth="amount"
        oLabel
        projection="radial"
        size={[300, 300]}
        style={(d) => ({
          fill: palette.data.crimson1,
          fillOpacity: d.status === "Eaten" ? 0.3 : 1,
          strokeWidth: 0,
        })}
        type="bar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
    <ChartWrapper>
      <XYFrame
        axes={[{ orient: "left" }, { orient: "bottom" }]}
        lines={[
          {
            coordinates: cityTemperature.map((r, i) => ({
              time: i,
              temp: Number(r.Austin),
            })),
          },
          {
            coordinates: cityTemperature.map((r, i) => ({
              time: i,
              temp: Number(r["New York"]),
            })),
          },
        ]}
        lineStyle={(d, i) => ({ stroke: palette.data.defaultOrder[i] })}
        size={[700, 400]}
        xAccessor="time"
        yAccessor="temp"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Semiotic also doesn't render any legends for you. You can overlay one on your chart
by providing SVG JSX to the `foregroundGraphics` prop, or simply render one alongside
your chart in HTML.

## Tooltips

You can get a default tooltip (with styling provided by `ChartWrapper`) simply by
passing `hoverAnnotation={true}` to any Semiotic component. Unfortunately the default
behavior is ... not amazing:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Tooltips">
    <ChartWrapper>
      <OrdinalFrame
        axes={[
          {
            orient: "left",
          },
        ]}
        data={letterFrequency}
        hoverAnnotation
        oAccessor="letter"
        oLabel
        oPadding={5}
        rAccessor="frequency"
        size={[600, 300]}
        type="bar"
      />
    </ChartWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The overall tooltip API is pretty powerful however, you should dig into
[the docs](https://semiotic.nteract.io/guides/tooltips)
if you'd like to do anything more advanced than this.

Particularly cumbersome is the placement algorithm; Semiotic divides the chart
into "hoverable" regions based on the data points and places the tooltip at
the center of the one you've targeted. This works pretty well for scatter plots
and more or less poorly for everything else. You may find yourself overriding styles
computing some positioning offsets on the fly in the tooltip rendering function.

<Canvas>
  <ChartWrapper>
    <OrdinalFrame
      axes={[
        {
          orient: "left",
        },
      ]}
      data={letterFrequency}
      hoverAnnotation
      oAccessor="letter"
      oLabel
      oPadding={5}
      rAccessor="frequency"
      size={[600, 300]}
      tooltipContent={(d) => {
        return (
          <div
            className="tooltip-content"
            style={{
              // e.g., counteract the Y offset
              // so the tooltip doesn't jump up and down
              transform: `translate(0, ${-d.column.xyData[0].xy.y + 100}px)`,
            }}
          >
            <div>
              {d.summary[0].column}: {d.summary[0].value}
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      }}
      type="bar"
    />
  </ChartWrapper>
</Canvas>

## Typescript

Semiotic ships with Typescript definitions, but be advised that they are spotty.
The Semiotic API relies a lot on argument overloading and dynamic properties
derived from the input data, and these are not always adequately captured
by the interface definitions. It's not uncommon to copy an example directly
from the Semiotic documentation and have Typescript object to it! Don't be afraid
to override the types when you know your code works.
