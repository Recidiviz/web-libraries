# Tabs

The tab feature actually comprises four related components that must be used together:
`Tabs`, `TabList`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel`. The underlying functionality for these
components is handled by [react-tabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tabs),
which we have augmented with additional styles.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Tabs">
    <Tabs>
      <TabList>
        <Tab>One</Tab>
        <Tab>The Second Tab</Tab>
        <Tab>
          <Icon kind="Star" size={24} />
        </Tab>
      </TabList>
      <TabPanel>
        <div>contents of first tab</div>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        <div>contents of second tab</div>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        <div>contents of third tab</div>
      </TabPanel>
    </Tabs>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
